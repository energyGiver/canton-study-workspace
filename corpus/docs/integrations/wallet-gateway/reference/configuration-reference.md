# Configuration reference

> Full reference for the Wallet Gateway store backends, backups, signing store, and secrets.

This reference complements the task-oriented guides with the details you need for production:
the store backends in full, backup and recovery, signing store security, and how to handle
secrets across environments. For the config file's overall shape, see
[Configure the Wallet Gateway](/integrations/wallet-gateway/operate/configure). For networks and
authentication, see [Networks & identity providers](/integrations/wallet-gateway/operate/networks-and-identity).

## Full configuration schema

For the complete JSON Schema of the configuration file, including every field and type, run:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
wallet-gateway --config-schema
```

Use the output for validation and IDE autocompletion; the generated schema is the authoritative
source for all configuration options.

## Store backends

The `store.connection` object selects one of three backends.

### PostgreSQL

Recommended for production for its robustness, concurrent access, and backup support.

| Field      | Required            | Description                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`     | yes                 | Must be `"postgres"`.                                                                                             |
| `host`     | yes                 | Hostname or IP of the PostgreSQL server.                                                                          |
| `port`     | no (default `5432`) | Port PostgreSQL listens on.                                                                                       |
| `user`     | yes                 | Database user to connect with.                                                                                    |
| `password` | yes                 | Password for the database user.                                                                                   |
| `database` | yes                 | Name of the database to use (must exist).                                                                         |
| `ssl`      | no                  | TLS settings, passed through to the Node.js `pg` driver. See [PostgreSQL over TLS/SSL](#postgresql-over-tls-ssl). |

```json theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
{
    "store": {
        "connection": {
            "type": "postgres",
            "host": "db.example.com",
            "port": 5432,
            "user": "wallet_gateway",
            "password": "secure-password",
            "database": "wallet_gateway_db"
        }
    }
}
```

### PostgreSQL over TLS/SSL

If your PostgreSQL server requires TLS (common in managed databases and hardened deployments),
add an `ssl` object under `store.connection` and, if used, `signingStore.connection`. The Wallet
Gateway only configures client-side TLS; it never needs the server's private key.

**Local testing** (self-signed server cert, encryption only): set `rejectUnauthorized: false`.

```json theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
{
    "store": {
        "connection": {
            "type": "postgres",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 5432,
            "user": "postgres",
            "password": "postgres",
            "database": "app_db",
            "ssl": { "rejectUnauthorized": false }
        }
    }
}
```

**Production** (verify the server certificate): set `rejectUnauthorized: true` and provide the CA
certificate PEM that signed the server certificate via `ssl.ca`.

```json theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
{
    "store": {
        "connection": {
            "type": "postgres",
            "host": "db.example.com",
            "port": 5432,
            "user": "wallet_gateway",
            "password": "secure-password",
            "database": "wallet_gateway_db",
            "ssl": {
                "rejectUnauthorized": true,
                "ca": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### SQLite

Suitable for single-instance deployments and local development. Stores all data in one file.

| Field      | Required | Description                       |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `type`     | yes      | Must be `"sqlite"`.               |
| `database` | yes      | Path to the SQLite database file. |

```json theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
{
    "store": {
        "connection": {
            "type": "sqlite",
            "database": "store.sqlite"
        }
    }
}
```

### Memory

Keeps all data in RAM. Useful for testing, not for production.

| Field  | Required | Description         |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------- |
| `type` | yes      | Must be `"memory"`. |

```json theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
{
    "store": {
        "connection": {
            "type": "memory"
        }
    }
}
```

## Backups and recovery

The store database holds user sessions, networks and IDPs (seeded from bootstrap, then
modifiable at runtime), wallet configurations and party mappings, and in-flight transactions.

If the database is lost and cannot be restored:

* All sessions are invalidated (users must log in again).
* Networks and IDPs are re-seeded from bootstrap, but runtime changes are lost.
* In-flight transactions are lost and may need manual intervention.
* Wallets referencing lost networks may need reconfiguration.

Recommendations:

* **PostgreSQL**: use `pg_dump` or an automated solution (pgBackRest, WAL-E).
* **SQLite**: copy the database file regularly, with no writes during the copy.
* Schedule automated daily backups with a retention policy, and test restores.

<Warning>
  If the Wallet Gateway is used as the signing provider, the signing store holds private keys. If it is
  lost, those keys are unrecoverable. Do not use internal signing for any important system. See
  [Signing providers](/integrations/wallet-gateway/operate/signing-providers).
</Warning>

## Signing store security

The optional `signingStore` uses the same connection options as `store` and is only needed for
the internal signing provider. When it holds keys:

* Store the file in a secure location with restricted access.
* Use strict filesystem permissions (for example `chmod 600` for SQLite files).
* For PostgreSQL, use separate credentials with minimal privileges.
* Consider encrypting the database at rest.
* Back it up regularly if it holds production keys.
* Never commit signing store files to version control.

## Secrets and environments

Maintain separate configuration files per environment (for example `config.dev.json`,
`config.staging.json`, `config.prod.json`) to isolate settings and credentials.

Never commit secrets. Override sensitive values with environment variables using the `Env`
suffix on the field, for example `clientSecretEnv`:

```json theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
{
    "bootstrap": {
        "networks": [
            {
                "auth": {
                    "clientSecretEnv": "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Then set the variable when running:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="my-secret"
wallet-gateway -c ./config.json
```

Additional guidance:

* Network and IDP configurations (excluding secrets) are visible to users with ledger access.
* Anyone with read access to a shared config repository can see non-secret configuration.
* Use environment variables or a secret manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for
  sensitive values.
* `adminAuth` credentials are sensitive: store them securely, rotate them regularly, and use
  them only where truly needed.

### Suggested environment profiles
