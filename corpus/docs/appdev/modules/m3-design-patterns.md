# Composition and Design Patterns

> Compose multi-step transactions, understand Daml's execution model and privacy, and apply common multi-party workflow patterns

# Compose choices

It's time to put everything you've learned so far together into a complete and secure Daml model for asset issuance, management, transfer, and trading. This application will have capabilities similar to the one in the [CN Quickstart](/sdks-tools/reference-projects/cn-quickstart). In the process you will learn about a few more concepts:

* Daml projects, packages, and modules
* Composition of transactions
* Observers and stakeholders
* Daml's execution model
* Privacy

The model in this section is not a single Daml file, but a Daml project consisting of several files that depend on each other.

<Tip>
  Remember that you can load all the code for this section into a folder called `intro-compose` by running `dpm new intro-compose  --template daml-intro-compose`
</Tip>

## Daml projects

Daml is organized in projects, packages, and modules. A Daml project is specified using a single `daml.yaml` file, and compiles into a package in Daml's intermediate language, or bytecode equivalent, Daml-LF. Each Daml file within a project becomes a Daml module, which is a bit like a namespace. Each Daml project has a source root specified in the `source` parameter in the project's `daml.yaml` file. The package will include all modules specified in `*.daml` files beneath that source directory.

You can start a new project with a skeleton structure using `dpm new project-name` in the terminal. A minimal project would contain just a `daml.yaml` file and an empty directory of source files.

> Take a look at the `daml.yaml` for the this chapter's project:

```yaml theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
sdk-version: __VERSION__
name: __PROJECT_NAME__
source: daml
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  - daml-prim
  - daml-stdlib
  - daml-script
```

You can generally set `name` and `version` freely to describe your project. `dependencies` does what the name suggests: it includes dependencies. You should always include `daml-prim` and `daml-stdlib`. The former contains internals of the compiler and the Daml Runtime, the latter gives access to the Daml standard library. `daml-script` contains the types and functions for Daml Script.

You compile a Daml project by running `dpm build` from the project root directory. This creates a DAR file in `.daml/dist/dist/${project_name}-${project_version}.dar`. A DAR file is Daml's equivalent of a JAR file in Java: it's the artifact that gets deployed to a ledger to load the package and its dependencies. `dar` files are fully self-contained in that they contain all dependencies of the main package. More on all of this in [Building and Packaging](/appdev/modules/m3-building-packaging).

## Project structure

This project contains an asset holding model for transferable, fungible assets and a separate trade workflow. The templates are structured in three modules: `Intro.Asset`, `Intro.Asset.Role`, and `Intro.Asset.Trade`.

In addition, there are tests in modules `Test.Intro.Asset`, `Test.Intro.Asset.Role`, and `Test.Intro.Asset.Trade`.

All but the last `.`-separated segment in module names correspond to paths relative to the project source directory, and the last one to a file name. The folder structure therefore looks like this:

```none theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
.
├── daml
│   ├── Intro
│   │   ├── Asset
│   │   │   ├── Role.daml
│   │   │   └── Trade.daml
│   │   └── Asset.daml
│   └── Test
│       └── Intro
│           ├── Asset
│           │   ├── Role.daml
│           │   └── Trade.daml
│           └── Asset.daml
└── daml.yaml
```

Each file contains a module header. For example, `daml/Intro/Asset/Role.daml`:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
module Intro.Asset.Role where
```

You can import one module into another using the `import` keyword. The `LibraryModules` module imports all six modules:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
import Intro.Asset
```

Imports always have to appear just below the module declaration. You can optionally add a list of names after the import to import only the selected names:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
import DA.List (sortOn, groupOn)
```

If your module contains any Daml Scripts, you need to import the corresponding functionality:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
import Daml.Script
```

## Project overview

The project both changes and adds to the `Iou` model presented in [Authorization](/appdev/modules/m3-authorization):

* Assets are fungible in the sense that they have `Merge` and `Split` choices that allow the `owner` to manage their holdings.

* Transfer proposals now need the authorities of both `issuer` and `newOwner` to accept. This makes `Asset` safer than `Iou` from the issuer's point of view.

  With the `Iou` model, an `issuer` could end up owing cash to anyone as transfers were authorized by just `owner` and `newOwner`. In this project, only parties having an `AssetHolder` contract can end up owning assets. This allows the `issuer` to determine which parties may own their assets.

* The `Trade` template adds a swap of two assets to the model.

## Composed choices and scripts

This project showcases how you can put the `Update` and `Script` actions you learned about in [Authorization](/appdev/modules/m3-authorization) to good use. For example, the `Merge` and `Split` choices each perform several actions in their consequences.

* Two create actions in case of `Split`
* One create and one archive action in case of `Merge`

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
choice Split
      : SplitResult
      with
        splitQuantity : Decimal
      controller owner
      do
        splitAsset <- create this with
          quantity = splitQuantity
        remainder <- create this with
          quantity = quantity - splitQuantity
        return SplitResult with
          splitAsset
          remainder

    choice Merge
      : ContractId Asset
      with
        otherCid : ContractId Asset
      controller owner
      do
        other <- fetch otherCid
        assertMsg
          "Merge failed: issuer does not match"
          (issuer == other.issuer)
        assertMsg
          "Merge failed: owner does not match"
          (owner == other.owner)
        assertMsg
          "Merge failed: symbol does not match"
          (symbol == other.symbol)
        archive otherCid
        create this with
          quantity = quantity + other.quantity
```

The `return` function used in `Split` is available in any `Action` context. The result of `return x` is a no-op containing the value `x`. It has an alias `pure`, indicating that it's a pure value, as opposed to a value with side-effects. The `return` name makes sense when it's used as the last statement in a `do` block as its argument is indeed the "return"-value of the `do` block in that case.

Taking transaction composition a step further, the `Trade_Settle` choice on `Trade` composes two `exercise` actions:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
choice Trade_Settle
      : (ContractId Asset, ContractId Asset)
      with
        quoteAssetCid : ContractId Asset
        baseApprovalCid : ContractId TransferApproval
      controller quoteAsset.owner
      do
        fetchedBaseAsset <- fetch baseAssetCid
        assertMsg
          "Base asset mismatch"
          (baseAsset == fetchedBaseAsset with
            observers = baseAsset.observers)

        fetchedQuoteAsset <- fetch quoteAssetCid
        assertMsg
          "Quote asset mismatch"
          (quoteAsset == fetchedQuoteAsset with
            observers = quoteAsset.observers)

        transferredBaseCid <- exercise
          baseApprovalCid TransferApproval_Transfer with
            assetCid = baseAssetCid

        transferredQuoteCid <- exercise
          quoteApprovalCid TransferApproval_Transfer with
            assetCid = quoteAssetCid

        return (transferredBaseCid, transferredQuoteCid)
```

The resulting transaction, with its two nested levels of consequences, can be seen in the `test_trade` script in `Test.Intro.Asset.Trade`:

```none theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}

                                   owner = 'Bob';
                                   symbol = "USD";
                                   quantity = 100.0000000000;
                                   observers = []

    #14:7

        └─> 'Alice' and 'EUR_Bank' create Intro.Asset:Asset
                                   with
                                     issuer = 'EUR_Bank';
                                     owner = 'Alice';
                                     symbol = "EUR";
                                     quantity = 90.0000000000;
                                     observers = []
```

Similar to choices, you can see how the scripts in this project are built up from each other:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
test_issuance = do
  setupResult@(alice, bob, bank, aha, ahb) <- setupRoles

  assetCid <- submit bank do
    exerciseCmd aha Issue_Asset
      with
        symbol = "USD"
        quantity = 100.0

  Some asset <- queryContractId bank assetCid
  assert (asset == Asset with
      issuer = bank
      owner = alice
      symbol = "USD"
      quantity = 100.0
      observers = []
        )

  return (setupResult, assetCid)
```

In the above, the `test_issuance` script in `Test.Intro.Asset.Role` uses the output of the `setupRoles` script in the same module.

The same line shows a new kind of pattern matching. Rather than writing `setupResult <- setupRoles` and then accessing the components of `setupResult` using `_1`, `_2`, etc., you can give them names. It's equivalent to writing:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
setupResult <- setupRoles
case setupResult of
  (alice, bob, bank, aha, ahb) -> ...
```

Just writing `(alice, bob, bank, aha, ahb) <- setupRoles` would also be legal, but `setupResult` is used in the return value of `test_issuance` so it makes sense to give it a name, too. The notation with `@` allows you to give both the whole value as well as its constituents names in one go.

## Daml's execution model

Daml's execution model is fairly easy to understand, but has some important consequences. You can imagine the life of a transaction as follows:

Command submission
A user submits a list of commands via the Ledger API of a participant node, acting as a `Party` hosted on that node. That party is called the requester.

Interpretation
Each command corresponds to one or more actions. During this step, the `Update` corresponding to each action is evaluated in the context of the ledger to calculate all consequences, including transitive ones (consequences of consequences, etc.). The result of this is a complete transaction. Together with its requestor, this is also known as a commit.

Blinding
On ledgers with strong privacy, projections (see [Privacy Model](/overview/learn/privacy-model)) for all involved parties are created. This is also called *projecting*.

Transaction submission
The transaction/commit is submitted to the network.

Validation
The transaction/commit is validated by the network. Who exactly validates can differ from implementation to implementation. Validation also involves scheduling and collision detection, ensuring that the transaction has a well-defined place in the (partial) ordering of commits, and no double spends occur.

Commitment
The commit is actually committed according to the commit or consensus protocol of the ledger.

Confirmation
The network sends confirmations of the commitment back to all involved participant nodes.

Completion
The user gets back a confirmation through the Ledger API of the submitting participant node.

The first important consequence of the above is that all transactions are committed atomically. Either a transaction is committed as a whole and for all participants, or it fails.

That's important in the context of the `Trade_Settle` choice shown above. The choice transfers a `baseAsset` one way and a `quoteAsset` the other way. Thanks to transaction atomicity, there is no chance that either party is left out of pocket.

The second consequence is that the requester of a transaction knows all consequences of their submitted transaction -- there are no surprises in Daml. However, it also means that the requester must have all the information to interpret the transaction. We also refer to this as Principle 2 a bit later on this page.

That's also important in the context of `Trade`. In order to allow Bob to interpret a transaction that transfers Alice's cash to Bob, Bob needs to know both about Alice's `Asset` contract, as well as about some way for `Alice` to accept a transfer -- remember, accepting a transfer needs the authority of `issuer` in this example.

## Observers

*Observers* are Daml's mechanism to disclose contracts to other parties. They are declared just like signatories, but using the `observer` keyword, as shown in the `Asset` template:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template Asset
  with
    issuer : Party
    owner : Party
    symbol : Text
    quantity : Decimal
    observers : [Party]
  where
    signatory issuer, owner
    ensure quantity > 0.0

    observer observers
```

The `Asset` template also gives the `owner` a choice to set the observers, and you can see how Alice uses it to show her `Asset` to Bob just before proposing the trade. You can try out what happens if she didn't do that by removing that transaction:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
usdCid <- submit alice do
    exerciseCmd usdCid SetObservers with
      newObservers = [bob]
```

Observers have guarantees in Daml. In particular, they are guaranteed to see actions that create and archive the contract on which they are an observer.

Since observers are calculated from the arguments of the contract, they always know about each other. That's why, rather than adding Bob as an observer on Alice's `AssetHolder` contract, and using that to authorize the transfer in `Trade_Settle`, Alice creates a one-time authorization in the form of a `TransferAuthorization`. If Alice had lots of counterparties, she would otherwise end up leaking them to each other.

Choice controllers are not automatically made observers, as they can only be calculated at the point in time when the choice arguments are known.

## Privacy

Daml's privacy model is based on two principles:

Principle 1. Parties see those actions that they have a stake in. Principle 2. Every party that sees an action sees its (transitive) consequences.

Principle 2 is necessary to ensure that every party can independently verify the validity of every transaction they see.

A party has a stake in an action if

* they are a required authorizer of it
* they are a signatory of the contract on which the action is performed
* they are an observer on the contract, and the action creates or archives it

What does that mean for the `exercise tradeCid Trade_Settle` action from `test_trade`?

Alice is the signatory of `tradeCid` and Bob a required authorizer of the `Trade_Settled` action, so both of them see it. According to principle 2 above, that means they get to see everything in the transaction.

The consequences contain, next to some `fetch` actions, two `exercise` actions of the choice `TransferApproval_Transfer`.

Each of the two involved `TransferApproval` contracts is signed by a different `issuer`, which see the action on "their" contract. So the EUR\_Bank sees the `TransferApproval_Transfer` action for the EUR `Asset` and the USD\_Bank sees the `TransferApproval_Transfer` action for the USD `Asset`.

Some Daml ledgers, like the script runner and the Sandbox, work on the principle of "data minimization", meaning nothing more than the above information is distributed. That is, the "projection" of the overall transaction that gets distributed to EUR\_Bank in step 4 of `execution_model` would consist only of the `TransferApproval_Transfer` and its consequences.

Other implementations, in particular those on public blockchains, may have weaker privacy constraints.

### Divulgence

Note that principle 2 of the privacy model means that sometimes parties see contracts that they are not signatories or observers on. If you look at the final ledger state of the `test_trade` script, for example, you may notice that both Alice and Bob now see both assets, as indicated by the Xs in their respective columns:

| Alice | Bob | EUR\_Bank | USD\_Bank | id     | status | issuer    | owner | symbol | quantity |
| ----- | --- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------ | --------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| X     | X   | -         | X         | #15:6  | active | USD\_Bank | Bob   | USD    | 100.0    |
| X     | X   | X         | -         | #15:10 | active | EUR\_Bank | Alice | EUR    | 90.0     |

This is because the `create` action of these contracts are in the transitive consequences of the `Trade_Settle` action both of them have a stake in. This kind of disclosure is often called "divulgence" and needs to be considered when designing Daml models for privacy sensitive applications.

## Common Daml design patterns

Beyond the composition patterns above, this section covers common multi-party workflow patterns used in Daml. All examples below use a `Coin` asset model to illustrate each pattern.

### Propose-Accept

The most common way to get multiple parties to agree on a shared contract. One party creates a proposal contract that the other party can accept, reject, or let expire. The `IouProposal` [in the authorization module](/appdev/modules/m3-authorization#use-propose-accept-workflow-for-one-off-authorization) is another example of this pattern.

The issuer creates a `CoinMaster` contract, then uses it to invite an owner. The invitation is a proposal contract with the issuer as signatory and the owner as observer:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template CoinMaster
  with
    issuer: Party
  where
    signatory issuer

    nonconsuming choice Invite : ContractId CoinIssueProposal
      with owner: Party
      controller issuer
      do create CoinIssueProposal
            with coinAgreement = CoinIssueAgreement with issuer; owner
```

The proposal gives the owner a choice to accept. In a complete model, it would also include `Reject` and `Counter` choices:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template CoinIssueProposal
  with
    coinAgreement: CoinIssueAgreement
  where
    signatory coinAgreement.issuer
    observer coinAgreement.owner

    choice AcceptCoinProposal
      : ContractId CoinIssueAgreement
      controller coinAgreement.owner
      do create coinAgreement
```

When the owner accepts, the result contract has both parties as signatories — neither can be forced into the agreement without consent:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template CoinIssueAgreement
  with
    issuer: Party
    owner: Party
  where
    signatory issuer, owner

    nonconsuming choice Issue : ContractId Coin
      with amount: Decimal
      controller issuer
      do create Coin with issuer; owner; amount; delegates = []
```

This pattern can be verbose when more than two signatures are needed — see Multiple Party Agreement below for that case.

### Delegation

Gives one party the right to exercise a choice on behalf of another. The principal creates a delegation contract that authorizes an agent to act for them, without the principal committing each action. This models real-world custodian relationships where a bank holds securities and settles transactions on a client's behalf.

The delegation contract (`CoinPoA` — Power of Attorney) has the principal as signatory. The attorney controls a `TransferCoin` choice that exercises `Transfer` on the principal's coin:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template CoinPoA
  with
    attorney: Party
    principal: Party
  where
    signatory principal
    observer attorney

    choice WithdrawPoA
      : ()
      controller principal
      do return ()

    -- Attorney has the delegated right to Transfer
    nonconsuming choice TransferCoin
      : ContractId TransferProposal
      with
        coinId: ContractId Coin
        newOwner: Party
      controller attorney
      do
        exercise coinId Transfer with newOwner
```

The coin must be disclosed to the attorney before they can exercise the delegated choice. This is done by adding them as an observer via a `Disclose` choice on `Coin`:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
choice Disclose : ContractId Coin
      with p : Party
      controller owner
      do create this with delegates = p :: delegates
```

### Authorization

Verifies that a controlling party has the right permissions before they take certain actions. An authorization contract serves as proof — the choice body checks for its existence and validity before proceeding.

For example, an issuer wants to ensure that only accredited parties can receive coin transfers. The issuer creates an authorization token for approved owners:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template CoinOwnerAuthorization
  with
    owner: Party
    issuer: Party
  where
    signatory issuer
    observer owner

    choice WithdrawAuthorization
      : ()
      controller issuer
      do return ()
```

The `AcceptTransfer` choice on `TransferProposal` requires the new owner to supply their authorization token. The asserts verify the token matches the issuer and the new owner:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
choice AcceptTransfer
      : ContractId Coin
      with token: ContractId CoinOwnerAuthorization
      controller newOwner
      do
        t <- fetch token
        assert (coin.issuer == t.issuer)
        assert (newOwner == t.owner)
        create coin with owner = newOwner
```

If the issuer withdraws the authorization before the transfer is accepted, the transfer fails.

### Locking

Prevents choices from being exercised on a contract while it is in a locked state. Useful for scenarios like securities settlement where assets must be frozen during clearing.

One approach is **locking by state change** — the contract carries a `locker` field. When `owner == locker`, the coin is unlocked and can be transferred. When they differ, a third-party locker controls the unlock:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template LockableCoin
  with
    owner: Party
    issuer: Party
    amount: Decimal
    locker: Party
  where
    signatory issuer, owner
    observer locker

    ensure amount > 0.0

    -- Transfer can only happen if not locked
    choice Transfer : ContractId TransferProposal
      with newOwner: Party
      controller owner
      do
        assert (locker == owner)
        create TransferProposal with coin=this; newOwner

    -- Lock by bringing a locker on board
    choice Lock : ContractId LockableCoin
      with newLocker: Party
      controller owner
      do
        assert (newLocker /= owner)
        create this with locker = newLocker

    -- Unlock restores owner control
    choice Unlock
      : ContractId LockableCoin
      controller locker
      do
        assert (locker /= owner)
        create this with locker = owner
```

Two other approaches exist: **locking by archiving** (archive the original contract and create a `LockedCoin` wrapper with `Unlock` and `Clawback` choices) and **locking by safekeeping** (transfer custody to a trusted third party who controls the unlock).

### Multiple party agreement

Collects signatures from more than two parties. A `Pending` contract wraps the final `Agreement` and tracks who has signed. Each party signs by exercising a `Sign` choice, and once all parties have signed, any of them can `Finalize` to create the agreement.

The final agreement contract has multiple signatories:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template Agreement
  with
    signatories: [Party]
  where
    signatory signatories
    ensure unique signatories
```

The `Pending` contract collects signatures one by one. It is observable by all required signatories, so each can see when it is their turn to sign:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
toSign : Pending -> [Party]
toSign Pending { alreadySigned, finalContract } =
  filter (`notElem` alreadySigned) finalContract.signatories

template Pending
  with
    finalContract: Agreement
    alreadySigned: [Party]
  where
    signatory alreadySigned
    observer finalContract.signatories
    ensure unique alreadySigned

    choice Sign : ContractId Pending with
        signer : Party
      controller signer
        do
          assert (signer `elem` toSign this)
          create this with alreadySigned = signer :: alreadySigned

    choice Finalize : ContractId Agreement with
        signer : Party
      controller signer
        do
          assert (sort alreadySigned == sort finalContract.signatories)
          create finalContract
```

One party kicks off the workflow by creating a `Pending` contract listing only themselves as signed. The others sign in any order, and once complete, any signatory can finalize:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
-- Any party can kick off by creating a Pending listing only themselves
pending <- person1 `submit` do
  createCmd Pending with finalContract; alreadySigned = [person1]

-- Each party signs
pending <- person2 `submit` do exerciseCmd pending Sign with signer = person2
pending <- person3 `submit` do exerciseCmd pending Sign with signer = person3
pending <- person4 `submit` do exerciseCmd pending Sign with signer = person4

-- Once all have signed, any signatory can finalize
person1 `submit` do exerciseCmd pending Finalize with signer = person1
```

# Compose choices

It's time to put everything you've learned so far together into a complete and secure Daml model for asset issuance, management, transfer, and trading. This application will have capabilities similar to the one in the [CN Quickstart](/sdks-tools/reference-projects/cn-quickstart). In the process you will learn about a few more concepts:

* Daml projects, packages, and modules
* Composition of transactions
* Observers and stakeholders
* Daml's execution model
* Privacy

The model in this section is not a single Daml file, but a Daml project consisting of several files that depend on each other.

<Tip>
  Remember that you can load all the code for this section into a folder called `intro-compose` by running `dpm new intro-compose  --template daml-intro-compose`
</Tip>

## Daml projects

Daml is organized in projects, packages, and modules. A Daml project is specified using a single `daml.yaml` file, and compiles into a package in Daml's intermediate language, or bytecode equivalent, Daml-LF. Each Daml file within a project becomes a Daml module, which is a bit like a namespace. Each Daml project has a source root specified in the `source` parameter in the project's `daml.yaml` file. The package will include all modules specified in `*.daml` files beneath that source directory.

You can start a new project with a skeleton structure using `dpm new project-name` in the terminal. A minimal project would contain just a `daml.yaml` file and an empty directory of source files.

> Take a look at the `daml.yaml` for the this chapter's project:

```yaml theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
sdk-version: __VERSION__
name: __PROJECT_NAME__
source: daml
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  - daml-prim
  - daml-stdlib
  - daml-script
```

You can generally set `name` and `version` freely to describe your project. `dependencies` does what the name suggests: it includes dependencies. You should always include `daml-prim` and `daml-stdlib`. The former contains internals of the compiler and the Daml Runtime, the latter gives access to the Daml standard library. `daml-script` contains the types and functions for Daml Script.

You compile a Daml project by running `dpm build` from the project root directory. This creates a DAR file in `.daml/dist/dist/${project_name}-${project_version}.dar`. A DAR file is Daml's equivalent of a JAR file in Java: it's the artifact that gets deployed to a ledger to load the package and its dependencies. `dar` files are fully self-contained in that they contain all dependencies of the main package. More on all of this in `dependencies`.

## Project structure

This project contains an asset holding model for transferable, fungible assets and a separate trade workflow. The templates are structured in three modules: `Intro.Asset`, `Intro.Asset.Role`, and `Intro.Asset.Trade`.

In addition, there are tests in modules `Test.Intro.Asset`, `Test.Intro.Asset.Role`, and `Test.Intro.Asset.Trade`.

All but the last `.`-separated segment in module names correspond to paths relative to the project source directory, and the last one to a file name. The folder structure therefore looks like this:

```none theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
.
├── daml
│   ├── Intro
│   │   ├── Asset
│   │   │   ├── Role.daml
│   │   │   └── Trade.daml
│   │   └── Asset.daml
│   └── Test
│       └── Intro
│           ├── Asset
│           │   ├── Role.daml
│           │   └── Trade.daml
│           └── Asset.daml
└── daml.yaml
```

Each file contains a module header. For example, `daml/Intro/Asset/Role.daml`:

```daml theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
module Intro.Asset.Role where
```

You can import one module into another using the `import` keyword. The `LibraryModules` module imports all six modules:

```daml theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
import Intro.Asset
```

Imports always have to appear just below the module declaration. You can optionally add a list of names after the import to import only the selected names:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
import DA.List (sortOn, groupOn)
```

If your module contains any Daml Scripts, you need to import the corresponding functionality:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
import Daml.Script
```

## Project overview

The project both changes and adds to the `Iou` model presented in `parties`:

* Assets are fungible in the sense that they have `Merge` and `Split` choices that allow the `owner` to manage their holdings.

* Transfer proposals now need the authorities of both `issuer` and `newOwner` to accept. This makes `Asset` safer than `Iou` from the issuer's point of view.

  With the `Iou` model, an `issuer` could end up owing cash to anyone as transfers were authorized by just `owner` and `newOwner`. In this project, only parties having an `AssetHolder` contract can end up owning assets. This allows the `issuer` to determine which parties may own their assets.

* The `Trade` template adds a swap of two assets to the model.

## Composed choices and scripts

This project showcases how you can put the `Update` and `Script` actions you learned about in `parties` to good use. For example, the `Merge` and `Split` choices each perform several actions in their consequences.

* Two create actions in case of `Split`
* One create and one archive action in case of `Merge`

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
choice Split
      : SplitResult
      with
        splitQuantity : Decimal
      controller owner
      do
        splitAsset <- create this with
          quantity = splitQuantity
        remainder <- create this with
          quantity = quantity - splitQuantity
        return SplitResult with
          splitAsset
          remainder

    choice Merge
      : ContractId Asset
      with
        otherCid : ContractId Asset
      controller owner
      do
        other <- fetch otherCid
        assertMsg
          "Merge failed: issuer does not match"
          (issuer == other.issuer)
        assertMsg
          "Merge failed: owner does not match"
          (owner == other.owner)
        assertMsg
          "Merge failed: symbol does not match"
          (symbol == other.symbol)
        archive otherCid
        create this with
          quantity = quantity + other.quantity
```

The `return` function used in `Split` is available in any `Action` context. The result of `return x` is a no-op containing the value `x`. It has an alias `pure`, indicating that it's a pure value, as opposed to a value with side-effects. The `return` name makes sense when it's used as the last statement in a `do` block as its argument is indeed the "return"-value of the `do` block in that case.

Taking transaction composition a step further, the `Trade_Settle` choice on `Trade` composes two `exercise` actions:

```daml theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
choice Trade_Settle
      : (ContractId Asset, ContractId Asset)
      with
        quoteAssetCid : ContractId Asset
        baseApprovalCid : ContractId TransferApproval
      controller quoteAsset.owner
      do
        fetchedBaseAsset <- fetch baseAssetCid
        assertMsg
          "Base asset mismatch"
          (baseAsset == fetchedBaseAsset with
            observers = baseAsset.observers)

        fetchedQuoteAsset <- fetch quoteAssetCid
        assertMsg
          "Quote asset mismatch"
          (quoteAsset == fetchedQuoteAsset with
            observers = quoteAsset.observers)

        transferredBaseCid <- exercise
          baseApprovalCid TransferApproval_Transfer with
            assetCid = baseAssetCid

        transferredQuoteCid <- exercise
          quoteApprovalCid TransferApproval_Transfer with
            assetCid = quoteAssetCid

        return (transferredBaseCid, transferredQuoteCid)
```

The resulting transaction, with its two nested levels of consequences, can be seen in the `test_trade` script in `Test.Intro.Asset.Trade`:

```none theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}

                                   symbol = "USD";
                                   quantity = 100.0000000000;
                                   observers = []

                                   with
                                     issuer = 'EUR_Bank';
                                     owner = 'Alice';
                                     symbol = "EUR";
                                     quantity = 90.0000000000;
                                     observers = []
```

Similar to choices, you can see how the scripts in this project are built up from each other:

```daml theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
test_issuance = do
  setupResult@(alice, bob, bank, aha, ahb) <- setupRoles

  assetCid <- submit bank do
    exerciseCmd aha Issue_Asset
      with
        symbol = "USD"
        quantity = 100.0

  Some asset <- queryContractId bank assetCid
  assert (asset == Asset with
      issuer = bank
      owner = alice
      symbol = "USD"
      quantity = 100.0
      observers = []
        )

  return (setupResult, assetCid)
```

In the above, the `test_issuance` script in `Test.Intro.Asset.Role` uses the output of the `setupRoles` script in the same module.

The same line shows a new kind of pattern matching. Rather than writing `setupResult <- setupRoles` and then accessing the components of `setupResult` using `_1`, `_2`, etc., you can give them names. It's equivalent to writing:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
setupResult <- setupRoles
case setupResult of
  (alice, bob, bank, aha, ahb) -> ...
```

Just writing `(alice, bob, bank, aha, ahb) <- setupRoles` would also be legal, but `setupResult` is used in the return value of `test_issuance` so it makes sense to give it a name, too. The notation with `@` allows you to give both the whole value as well as its constituents names in one go.

## Daml's execution model

Daml's execution model is fairly easy to understand, but has some important consequences. You can imagine the life of a transaction as follows:

Command submission
A user submits a list of commands via the Ledger API of a participant node, acting as a `Party` hosted on that node. That party is called the requester.

Interpretation
Each command corresponds to one or more actions. During this step, the `Update` corresponding to each action is evaluated in the context of the ledger to calculate all consequences, including transitive ones (consequences of consequences, etc.). The result of this is a complete transaction. Together with its requestor, this is also known as a commit.

Blinding
On ledgers with strong privacy, projections (see `privacy`) for all involved parties are created. This is also called *projecting*.

Transaction submission
The transaction/commit is submitted to the network.

Validation
The transaction/commit is validated by the network. Who exactly validates can differ from implementation to implementation. Validation also involves scheduling and collision detection, ensuring that the transaction has a well-defined place in the (partial) ordering of commits, and no double spends occur.

Commitment
The commit is actually committed according to the commit or consensus protocol of the ledger.

Confirmation
The network sends confirmations of the commitment back to all involved participant nodes.

Completion
The user gets back a confirmation through the Ledger API of the submitting participant node.

The first important consequence of the above is that all transactions are committed atomically. Either a transaction is committed as a whole and for all participants, or it fails.

That's important in the context of the `Trade_Settle` choice shown above. The choice transfers a `baseAsset` one way and a `quoteAsset` the other way. Thanks to transaction atomicity, there is no chance that either party is left out of pocket.

The second consequence is that the requester of a transaction knows all consequences of their submitted transaction -- there are no surprises in Daml. However, it also means that the requester must have all the information to interpret the transaction. We also refer to this as Principle 2 a bit later on this page.

That's also important in the context of `Trade`. In order to allow Bob to interpret a transaction that transfers Alice's cash to Bob, Bob needs to know both about Alice's `Asset` contract, as well as about some way for `Alice` to accept a transfer -- remember, accepting a transfer needs the authority of `issuer` in this example.

## Observers

*Observers* are Daml's mechanism to disclose contracts to other parties. They are declared just like signatories, but using the `observer` keyword, as shown in the `Asset` template:

```haskell theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
template Asset
  with
    issuer : Party
    owner : Party
    symbol : Text
    quantity : Decimal
    observers : [Party]
  where
    signatory issuer, owner
    ensure quantity > 0.0

    observer observers
```

The `Asset` template also gives the `owner` a choice to set the observers, and you can see how Alice uses it to show her `Asset` to Bob just before proposing the trade. You can try out what happens if she didn't do that by removing that transaction:

```daml theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
usdCid <- submit alice do
    exerciseCmd usdCid SetObservers with
      newObservers = [bob]
```

Observers have guarantees in Daml. In particular, they are guaranteed to see actions that create and archive the contract on which they are an observer.

Since observers are calculated from the arguments of the contract, they always know about each other. That's why, rather than adding Bob as an observer on Alice's `AssetHolder` contract, and using that to authorize the transfer in `Trade_Settle`, Alice creates a one-time authorization in the form of a `TransferAuthorization`. If Alice had lots of counterparties, she would otherwise end up leaking them to each other.

Choice controllers are not automatically made observers, as they can only be calculated at the point in time when the choice arguments are known.

## Privacy

Daml's privacy model is based on two principles:

Principle 1. Parties see those actions that they have a stake in. Principle 2. Every party that sees an action sees its (transitive) consequences.

Principle 2 is necessary to ensure that every party can independently verify the validity of every transaction they see.

A party has a stake in an action if

* they are a required authorizer of it
* they are a signatory of the contract on which the action is performed
* they are an observer on the contract, and the action creates or archives it

What does that mean for the `exercise tradeCid Trade_Settle` action from `test_trade`?

Alice is the signatory of `tradeCid` and Bob a required authorizer of the `Trade_Settled` action, so both of them see it. According to principle 2 above, that means they get to see everything in the transaction.

The consequences contain, next to some `fetch` actions, two `exercise` actions of the choice `TransferApproval_Transfer`.

Each of the two involved `TransferApproval` contracts is signed by a different `issuer`, which see the action on "their" contract. So the EUR\_Bank sees the `TransferApproval_Transfer` action for the EUR `Asset` and the USD\_Bank sees the `TransferApproval_Transfer` action for the USD `Asset`.

Some Daml ledgers, like the script runner and the Sandbox, work on the principle of "data minimization", meaning nothing more than the above information is distributed. That is, the "projection" of the overall transaction that gets distributed to EUR\_Bank in step 4 of `execution_model` would consist only of the `TransferApproval_Transfer` and its consequences.

Other implementations, in particular those on public blockchains, may have weaker privacy constraints.

### Divulgence

Note that principle 2 of the privacy model means that sometimes parties see contracts that they are not signatories or observers on. If you look at the final ledger state of the `test_trade` script, for example, you may notice that both Alice and Bob now see both assets, as indicated by the Xs in their respective columns:

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/cantonfoundation/53J3Euu6q0XOxgPz/appdev/modules/images/compose/divulgence.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=53J3Euu6q0XOxgPz&q=85&s=a920641ce4bd1220282f433482af589b" alt="images/compose/divulgence.png" width="480" height="163" data-path="appdev/modules/images/compose/divulgence.png" />

This is because the `create` action of these contracts are in the transitive consequences of the `Trade_Settle` action both of them have a stake in. This kind of disclosure is often called "divulgence" and needs to be considered when designing Daml models for privacy sensitive applications.
