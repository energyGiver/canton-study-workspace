# Building Applications

> Go from Daml smart contracts to full-stack Canton Network applications

Module 4 bridges the gap between writing Daml contracts and shipping a complete application. You will learn how Canton applications are structured, which SDKs and APIs are available, and how to build both backend and frontend components that interact with the ledger.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed [Module 3: Daml Smart Contracts](/appdev/modules/m3-dev-environment). You need a working understanding of templates, choices, and authorization in Daml. Familiarity with Java or TypeScript is helpful but not required.

## What You Will Learn

* How Canton application architecture maps roles (App Provider, App User, End User) to infrastructure
* Which SDKs, APIs, and code generation tools are available for building against the ledger
* How to build a backend service that submits commands and reads transactions
* How to build a frontend that displays contract data and integrates with wallets
* How Canton Coin and traffic work from an application developer's perspective
