# Connectivity Issues

> Diagnosing and resolving synchronizer connection failures and TLS errors

Connectivity failures prevent your validator from communicating with the synchronizer. The symptoms vary -- from outright connection refusals to subtle TLS handshake errors -- but the diagnostic approach is consistent.

## Cannot Connect to Synchronizer

If your validator logs show:

```
Request failed for sequencer. Is the server running?
```

or

```
SEQUENCER_SUBSCRIPTION_LOST: Lost subscription to sequencer
```

Work through these checks in order.

### 1. Verify the Sequencer URL

Confirm that your configuration points to the correct sequencer endpoint for your target network:

* **DevNet:** `https://sequencer.dev.sync.global`
* **TestNet:** `https://sequencer.test.sync.global`
* **MainNet:** `https://sequencer.sync.global`

A common mistake is using the scan URL (`https://scan.sv-2...`) instead of the SV sponsor URL during onboarding. The scan URL is for read-only network data, not for validator registration.

### 2. Test Network Reachability

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
# DNS resolution
dig +short sequencer.sync.global

# TCP connectivity
nc -zv sequencer.sync.global 443

# Full TLS handshake
openssl s_client -connect sequencer.sync.global:443 -servername sequencer.sync.global </dev/null
```

If `nc` times out, a firewall or security group is blocking egress on port 443.

### 3. Check Firewall and Security Groups

Your validator requires outbound HTTPS on port 443 to the synchronizer. If you run in a cloud environment, verify:

* The security group attached to your instance or pod allows outbound TCP/443.
* No network ACL is blocking the traffic.
* If you use an HTTP proxy, Canton supports proxy configuration via JVM system properties (`-Dhttps.proxyHost`, `-Dhttps.proxyPort`).

## TLS Handshake Failures

TLS errors typically produce log messages like:

```
io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: io exception
Channel Pipeline: [SslHandler#0, ...]
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: PKIX path building failed
```

### Certificate Expiry

Check whether the server certificate has expired:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
openssl s_client -connect sequencer.sync.global:443 -servername sequencer.sync.global 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -noout -dates
```

If the certificate has expired and you control it (e.g., for your own validator's TLS termination), renew it and restart the TLS-terminating proxy or ingress controller.

### CA Trust Chain

If you see `PKIX path building failed`, the validator's JVM does not trust the server's certificate authority. Possible fixes:

* Import the CA certificate into the JVM truststore:

  ```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
  keytool -importcert -alias myca -file ca-cert.pem \
    -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit
  ```

* For Kubernetes, mount the CA bundle as a volume and set `JAVA_OPTS`:

  ```yaml theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
  env:
    - name: JAVA_OPTS
      value: "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/etc/ssl/truststore.jks"
  ```

### Hostname Mismatch

If the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) does not include the hostname you are connecting to, the handshake will fail. Verify with:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"github-dark"}}
openssl s_client -connect sequencer.sync.global:443 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -noout -ext subjectAltName
```
